Sophie's Website
========================================================

I am building a website together with my (8 year old) daughter,
and the progress is tracked in this repo. The website is here

## USE

Every numbered commit corresponds to a *pedagogical milestone*. 
There are also *double-dash* commits that are in between the
numbered one's. Those correspond to intermediate steps that are
put in for technical not pedagogical reasons.

The idea is to progress from one milestone to the next. For example,
the initial milestones are

1. a simple, unstyled webpage
2. the same page, style with css
3. multiple pages with the same template, using a single php file
4. creating php include files for the various content pages
5. ...

and my daughter and me went through them sequentially (of course
some of the stuff, especially at the later milestones, is rather
technical; there it is really about what one can do - eg in iPad
App - and she'll be able to look at it in her own time)

For your reference, [the list of all commits is here][commits]. 
Be warned that I am rewriting history very often, all the way to
the root commit, so if you pull this repo please be aware of 
this.
